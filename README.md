# DevMentor JavaScript Task 01

JavaScipt Tasks are part of the DevMentorship program of 2022 specifically targetting the improvenment of JavaScript skills.

## Task Introduction
Javascript is a scripting language that has a lot of use cases and capabilities with its diverse data types, arithmetic and logical operators.

## Tasks
Write simple Javascript code that solves the following problems;
1. We want to find the sum of all number between zero (0) and one hundred and one (101) - That is, `1 + 2 + 3 + ..... + 98 + 99 + 100`. Use your skill with Javascript to find a suitable solution to this challenge
2. We need to be sure that a randomly generated number is divisible by 2. Write a Js code that generates a random number, using the `random method` of the in-built `Math`  class to generate 5 random numbers, add them to an array and print out the last of them which is divisible by 2
3.  `Date` is a superb data available in Javascript which is of type `object`. Write a Js code that detects if a given date is valid. (You are expected to provide 5 data samples that can be used to test your solution)

## Submission
You are expected to create a private git repository (on github and add 'johnvict' and '10deyon'
